It is used to specify a date by providing the temporal components that make up a date and time: hour, minutes, seconds, day, month, year, and so on. It can also be used to specify a duration of time, for example, 5 hours and 16 minutes. An NSDateComponents object is not required to define all the component fields. When a new instance of NSDateComponents is created the date components are set to NSUndefinedDateComponent.	/// </summary>	[iOSVersion(2)]	public class NSDateComponents : NSObject	{		/// <summary>		/// Returns the number of era units for the receiver.		/// </summary>		/// <returns>The number of era units for the receiver.</returns>		[iOSVersion(2)]		[Export("era")]		public int Era { get;
